### [Internship] Shopee - Business Development
<div style="text-align: justify"> I learned a lot about <b>Excel Formulas</b> in Shopee, I started using more complex formulas to build the financial reports on my team's business plan as our thesis, including pivot table, importrange, etc. The biggest advantage was the auto-update of our ratios calculation like NPV, PP, BEP, and the reports such as P&L and Cash Budget, yet it is certainly necessary to set a limit for the auto-update, to prevent bullwhip errors from a small mistakes. I also enhanced and simplify the revenue-sharing calculation for my family's foodcourt using spreadsheet formulas. The challenges for revenue-sharing system were the multiple source of cash inflow (cashier & gojek) and outflow (supplies, receivables, and the sharing percentage itself). I also used pivot table to build financial reports after organizing the required raw data. Looking back at my university tasks, most of them could be done more efficiently, if I were creative enough to utilize that.</div>
