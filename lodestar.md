In the early 2019, I challenged myself to apply for Coordinator of Lodestar in my university. Lodestar is the title of a mentor for freshman in my university during the orientation period, which lasted for a semester. I have participated as a lodestar twice in 2017 and 2018, hence many asked me, "why are you still applying this year?" "don't you feel bored?" "why don't you try new things?". Well, its not that simple to answer everyone's questions. I believed that I applied because I have this confidence in myself, that I could contribute a greater impact for the organization and it's stakeholders. During the interview, one of the question was "what's a coordinator for you?", I answered, "2 main roles as a Coordinator of Lodestar are a regulator, enforcing rules and programs to establish guidelines for Lodestar performing their responsibilities, and as a Lodestar's Lodestar, giving examples as a mentor to encourage others to be one. Me and 5 other coordinators led 115 Lodestar throughout the 3 months preparation and 5 months orientation period. We faced numerous challenges during the period, one of which was the complexity of our schedule-planning. With the intensity of the program, it was very common to find clashing schedules with other organizations at that time. In this specific problem, I could say its similar to issues faced by organization with matrix structure, where each member have more than 1 reporting manager. As the one responsible for Lodestar's activities, We need to understand their concern, and react quickly to negotiate with related parties. Afterall, its not entirely the Lodestar's mistakes for such problems. Supporting them to the extent is a long-term investment for Lodestar's performances. I learned to negotiate effectively in 1 case, which resulted in our win-win solution. At first I was feeling nervous to moderate the discussion, I always tried to be tactful with my arguments, then conveyed them in such manner that won't offend or corner them. Luckily both of our parties agreed to proceed with the planning together.

During the orientation program, us 6 would meet frequently to finalize our programs together. It was very exciting to discuss with like-minded colleagues. Even though We had this different idealism, it rarely got in our way to led lodestars. We often gave feedback for each other and the program as well. I found that the bond between our team is really helpful during difficult times, we backed each other and prioritize our mutual goals above anything else. Taking it professionally, it is very likely to meet a team with diverse set of characters, bringing conflict during working together. However I'd perceive the differences as a natural advantage of my team wherever I am, because by having a different personal opinion means more and stronger ideas. This opinion of mine comes from several experiments in organizations, both as a follower and a leader. In many psychological tests that I have taken for fun, most of the times the results say that I am an introverted person, but during most organizational and academic activities, I really enjoyed collaborating with others while pursuing goals together. Lastly, I feel that working intensively with hundreds is really a great deal, in which I learned a lot to be comfortable and positive with difficult situations.
