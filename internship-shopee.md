I ended my internship program at Shopee Indonesia last month as a Business Development, in the middle of pandemic and hurried preparation for my thesis defense. The 3-months program was very exciting and challenging, where my performances could be measured in weekly basis, and the complex collaborations with related functions.<br/>

I started my first week with learning all about Shopee in general and also BD-related features on the platform. Then the difficulties and complexity of the tasks escalated very quickly, it was a month left to our special campaign 9.9 at that time. My supervisor assigned new responsibilities for me, to manage a huge part representing our category. I really felt what people say about startups, "dynamic, fast-changing, working from home", the pressure was real. I always asked help when necessary for all of those unwritten rules & procedures. Thankfully, my division could explained things very well, which guide me throughout the knowledge transfer process.<br/>

Things went by quickly, I mainly performed various campaign-related BAU (business as usual) frequently. That include evaluating campaign, communicating requirements, sku submission, and several research supports. In Shopee, we use complex and interconnected spreadsheets to collaborate, aside from the specific application that supported the process. I learned a lot about the formulas in spreadsheet, from the most basic to advanced since they're the fundamentals to perform my duties. At first, I stumbled across obstacles and I made mistakes. The feeling of insecure and overwhelmed were coming frequently. However, it was not a single turning point that forced me to be positive in the process, unlike those success films where the protagonist would hit the rock bottom, and then rise to the top on a time lapse. It was the support of others, the understanding of my own strengths and weaknesses, that made me able to learn lesson from my own mistakes, and keep on improving day by day. I assisted the team on 10.10 and 11.11 peak days campaign with more optimistic-self and luckily, things went very well for us! thanks to the previous experiences managing similar campaign, though there were still a lot of room for improvement.<br/>

Nearing the end of my internship program, I was so lucky to met new interns on our team, we were progressing together to repeat the process of transferring knowledge. They were very enthusiastic and fun to work with, and since we called everyday, its like knowing them much longer than it really is. I learned how to clearly explain things for the right person. I'd use either verbal explanation or virtual demonstration depending on the situation. The internship ended with a feeling of gratitude, my deepest thanks to Shopee for the precious internship opportunity! The program taught me many important things to excel as a professional. Thanks as well for all of the support from my colleagues in BD Automotive Category, its truly an honor to work with you guys. And now I am very excited to explore more about business development and analysis on my career journey!
